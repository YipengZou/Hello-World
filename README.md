# Hello-World
Just try to finish the tutorial

Hi I'm new here. To be honest I don't know how to use Github and I'm not so good at programming. Why I am trying to do this is because yesterday I heared senior students sharing 
their experiecen, one of them, who graduated from Columbia University, the Bussiness Analysis major, told us that a good Github profile can help you a lot in applying for jobs. Therefore I'd like to create one. Hope this can help me in programming and applying jobs!
